# Repository contents

This repository contains the full application which was built on Angular2 and FireBase. This is a demo application that I made to practice Angular2 and FireBase  

# Installing the Angular CLI

With the following command the angular-cli will be installed globally in your machine:

    npm install -g angular-cli

# Installing the code

The code can be installed with the following command (needs to be run in the folder where package.json is):

    npm install 
# Generating the sample data
The data can be generated by using a small function called `populate-dt` which takes data from `db-data`.

Run `npm run populate-db` in order to generate sample data

## Running the code
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
